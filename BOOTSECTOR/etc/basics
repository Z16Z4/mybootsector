ax ah al are accumulator sub parts of the eax register
 ^ general purpose 

 al is the lowest 8 bits of eax 


 hex ffa would be in ax , al register would be the ones used 

maps like so:
 ax registers > zeros, like 0e or 1 0 
 in 8 bit hex 

 ah would be high bits while al low 8 bits of 32 bit eax 

  "generic regisers"

  cs ds es 16 bit segment registers

  index registers such as esi edi, lower 16bits are si di
